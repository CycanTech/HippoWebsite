Our vision is to build a Decentralized Autonomous Organization（DAO） driven entirely by the community.<br/><br/>HIPPO is a lottery ticket and every day there is a chance to receive airdrops of various tokens in the Cycan ecosystem.<br/><br/>HIPPO is the governance token of the Cycan community and step-by-step, we will strive to achieve a true DAO by pure community governance.<br/><br/>HIPPO is a decentralized NFT market and will be burned for transaction fees.<br/><br/>HIPPO is a token distribution platform and according to the community’s preferences, suitable projects will be selected for airdrops or we can initiate an IDO in the community.<br/><br/>All rights of Hippo belong to the community and the future is determined by the community instead of a single person or organization, Hippo is filled with Possibilities.<br/><br/>Cycan Network is a decentralized cross-chain digital asset management platform, and will be complete infrastructures for DeFi and NFT. All the projects based on Cycan Network will be airdropped to HIPPO holders.
