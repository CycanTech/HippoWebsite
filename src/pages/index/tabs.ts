      EN: `Hello Everyone! After more than a week of waiting, the much-anticipated HIPPO airdrop is finally available.

Our HIP airdrop activity got underway on the 18th of May and will last until the end of June. Thanks to all the activity on Twitter and Weibo, we have received the attention and support of many friends at home and abroad. The number of BSC addresses we have collected so far has almost reached 60k. We have been pleasantly surprised and excited about the enthusiasm for Hippo. Thank you for your active participation!
       
On May 31, the Hippo-USDT trading pair is getting officially listed on Pancake and the airdrop will continue.
       
At the same time, the airdrop whitelist will be updated every day and it is here for those who want to apply, to do so and claim the airdrop on their own.
       
Hippo (HIP) is a thorough decentralized community experiment initiated by the Cycan community. Our vision is to build a Decentralized Autonomous Organization（DAO） driven entirely by the community. No team shares, no private placement, 70% of all airdrops are distributed to the community, 5% are distributed to community volunteers based on contributions, and 25% are used to create an initial liquidity pool and the private key will be destroyed.`
